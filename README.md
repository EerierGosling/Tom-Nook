Tom Nook is the welcome bot for my personal channel ([#eeriergosling](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C06V73WGACB)) on [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.slack.com) :D

Tom Nook is a character from Animal Crossing, a game I love. I thought it'd be fun to make him the welcome bot of my channel! In the game, he runs the shop on the island you live on and is very, very money hungry - so I made my bot just like him.

When you join my channel, Tom Nook greets you and "forces you" to buy something from his shop. You type in what you want and he sells it to you for a randomly generated amount of bells, which you pay by replying with emojis totaling to that amount.

Tom Nook is written in Python using Bolt and is hosted on [Nest](https://hackclub.app).
